In recent years Generative Artificial Intelligence has gained a lot of popularity and usage in our daily lives. Image Generation became popular with models like Stable Diffusion or DALL-E which showed the public what Image Generation is able to do. In this blog post, I aim to introduce and explain a new model, RAPHAEL, which outperforms models like Stable Diffusion and focuses on accurately displaying text in the generated images.

Why image generation?
======
Image Generation can be used to innovate in many areas. For example it can be used to vastly improve the speed and reduce the cost of making marketing ads, for example to create a simple poster we can just use the model to generate it for us instead of hiring actors, buying equipement and so on. Another area would be film making, where instead of manually animating scenes, which is time consuming and expensive, we can just generate the scenes. There are also many applications in Science and Engineering like for example discovering new drugs where these models can be used to find new molecules, which else would be a very time and money consuming process.

Recent models like Stable Diffusion or DALL-E have shown great success but often lack the ability to accurately display text in the generated images like shown below.

RAPHAEL aims at accurately displaying text in generated images and overall improving image quality.
